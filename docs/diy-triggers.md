# Build your own drum triggers

The most basic way of creating is a trigger is by using a contact microphone (also called a piezo disc, or piezo buzzer). The is a little metal disc with a ceramic top layer, that, when slightly bended continuously, outputs a small alternating voltage for the difference. This voltage can be captured by an external soundcard (interface) and used as an audio signal to listen to. Many of the consumer grade triggers (like the ddrum triggers) use this piezo disc as the technology for their trigger.

You can buy these piezo discs for less than â‚¬1 per piece. And since we are mainly interested in using the signal as a trigger (not for recording studio quality sounds) it is also not too important what the soundquality of the piezo is, just as long as a clear signal comes through.

In order to build your own triggers you will need to buy some additional things such as a cable, a jack (socket or plug) and possibly some tools for soldering, stripping the cable and so on. Below are lists of material needed with an example link, but depending on your location can also be bought in a local store.
